## Description:

This weather application allows users to look up the weather in multiple cities. Built from HTML & Bootstrap, it is dynamically powered by jQuery. The app retrieves data real-time from the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and maintains a search history of up to 8 cities. 
<br>
<br>

**Application Features:**

- Users can search by city
- Data will pull current temperature, humidity, wind speed and UV index as well as a 5-day forecast
- UV index changes color based on risk of harm from unprotected sun exposure (low, moderate, high, very high)
- Search history saves up to 8 cities
- When a city is clicked from the search history, that city's data will populate
